# Email Validator
Welcome to Email validator! The application is all accessible from the main home page with one easy to use interface. Make sure you have the app set up and runnning using our developer guide before you start trying to use the features. The app is made up of two parts, first a email checker to ensrue the email is legitamate then a form to check if an email address is already part of a mailing list before adding that email address to the database.

## Email Validator
Using the email validator is quite simple, all you need to do is insert the email into the box on the left hand side of the screen and hit submit. Then look for either a red or green text with the email address below. If the text is green the email address is valid, if red then the email address is not valid. You can also view additional details below in the table.

## Mailing list
This feature of our application is a two in one system. All you need to do is to enter the target email address into the text field and hit submit. You will then be provided either an error message or a a success confirmation. If the email is a duplicate you will be provided a message informing you of that.
